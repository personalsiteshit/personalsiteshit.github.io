                    <p id="hello_there" class="inner_text">“As We May Think” is a text written by Vannevar Bush, and published in The Atlantic in
1945. Bush was an American Engineer, scientist and inventor who took a central part in the
development of the atomic bomb and overseer of the Manhattan project (Atomic Heritage
Foundation 1). Written at the end of the second World War, Bush comments that the central
focus of physics based work was weaponry and combat mobilization, and further asks where
now physicists will find work that will be “worthy of their best" (Bush 1).<br><br>
Bush explains that the current practices in finding scholarly work is well outdated
considering the increasing number of scientific publications, using the example of Mendel,
stating “Mendel's concept of the laws of genetics was lost to the world for a generation because
his publication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and extending it;” (Bush 3).
He furthers this thought by reflecting on the antiquity of technology, and the rapid course of the
evolution of machinery that is taking place or will be taking place in the near future.
<br><br>Bush now approaches his thesis, stating “The real heart of the matter of selection,
however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of
development of devices for their use. Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by
the artificiality of systems of indexing. (Bush 15)” He addresses the issue of the intuitiveness of
modern indexing, explaining that the human mind does not operate by the logic of indexing. In
this sense, if the human mind operates by association, finding scholarly articles, which are
growing exponentially, will be impossible with mechanisms that are unintuitive to the human
mind.
Through this conclusion, Bush proposes a future invention coined the memex. The
memex is Bush’s solution to unintuitive indexing, further elaborating “If affords an immediate
step, however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item
may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential
feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing. (Bush, 16)”
<br><br>The logic Bush proposed lay inspiration for modern inventors, and is the framework by
which the web operates. More astounding is his insight when taken into consideration the
publication date of the article. To the credit of Bush, the web today has drastically decreased the
time and effort spent finding related work, and has been essential in modern day scientific
publications.

                    <p class="inner_text">From Counterculture to Cyberculture is a text written by Fred Turner. It recounts the history of
the internet and personal computing, starting from pre WWII up until the early 2000’s. The text
itself largely follows paragons of personal computing, and each of their respective impacts in its
domain. It elaborates on the evolution of computers, in size and computing power, as well as the
internet.<br><br>
The main idea in this text is the crossover by peers and professionals in the industry of each
scientist documented. It illustrates how various individual projects all tie together in the central
goal of Counterculture; counterculture being the autonomy that is the personal computer. It is a
device which allows individuals the freedom of information: where computers were once
gargantuan machines kept in basements of universities, scrupulously watched and protected, the
innovations of cybernetics now allow for a smaller (or portable) computer for personal and
private use.<br><br>
Furthermore, Turner illustrates how the function of computing drastically changed: which was
once a machine purely for calculation has now become an intrinsic element in human social
interaction; a device which revolutionized communication through the various projects that
helped bring the internet to fruition.<br><br>
Brand’s Catalog highlights the importance of individualism and community, having helped both
their designers and their future users imagine them as "personal" technologies.</p>

                    <h1>Title</h1>
                    <p class="inner_text">The article, written by Danial Joseph, describes a time in the early 70’s when Canada was
conceiving a national computer network. This was spurred by the worry by many of American
capitalism, which if left unchecked, would “eat Canada’s lunch”. A key issue arose when the
question of personal security was addressed: some were worried that the government “would use
it to spy on or collect data from residents.” Other questions of personal information being
privatized and commoditized were brought up, and the personal Canadian network
dematerialized and was never seen to fruition.<br><br>
The idea that information would be tracked or even regulated by the government in a national
computer network is more than plausible. Internet restrictions in China include restricting
content and monitoring individual usage.[2]
 With internet service providers being state owned,
China has the ability to implement various countermeasures, which include blocking ips entirely,
filtering packets, or rerouting ips to invalid sites.[1]
 These restrictions can bring to light the power
that comes from state controlled internet.<br><br>
The notion that a US-led internet has led to the degradation of personal security is misguided.
The example given was Facebook, and it’s various abuses of personal security. Facebook
however is privately owned. Katz in this sense was correct, predicting that “public, private,
mostly US-based interests would move forward with the privatization and commodification of
personal information.<br><br>
In summary, a state owned internet in an attempt to block the privatization of personal
information is a promising idea, but not without flaws. The threat of government regulation or
the distribution of personal information to private ownerships is prominent.</p>

                    <p class="inner_text">I, in particular, was shocked to discover that Gnu was just linux distributions, with linux being the kernel, and gnu the system. When I began reading The Gnu Manifesto, I almost immediately thought it was communist driven ideology in a seemingly new facet of life: computing. While it certainly shares some similarities in terms of consumerism, it strays extraordinary far from communism in terms of application; linux, and it’s many redistributions including arch linux to ubuntu, in combination with gnu (which I’m now aware of) amass one of the largest, tight-knit, supportive and successful communities of developers in the industry. I consider those feats very successful, especially in terms of what the original founder of the gnu project wanted to achieve. <br><br>“By working on and using GNU rather than proprietary programs, we can be hospitable to everyone and obey the law. In addition, GNU serves as an example to inspire and a banner to rally others to join us in sharing. This can give us a feeling of harmony which is impossible if we use software that is not free. For about half the programmers I talk to, this is an important happiness that money cannot replace.” It is not under the table knowledge that support for mac and especially windows machines are lacking. The most ironic complaint I discovered was “Nobody will use it if it is free, because that means they can't rely on any support.” “You have to charge for the program to pay for providing the support.” I’m not an avid user of linux based systems, though even I know that support comes directly from the community; avid programmers with extra time on their hands. The support is completely free, something even the founder of gnu did not predict in his response. Unfortunately, many of those new to computing generally don’t turn immediately to linux based systems. They can feel daunting and limited for someone whose skills are lackluster. As such, linux systems generally are used by developers. In terms of advertisement, again, it is passed on by word of mouth from developers. The idea to create an open source, licence free operating system full of community based contributions and efforts is honestly genius. <br><br>There is no surprise it worked out in the end, and generally touched on the goals it once sought out to achieve. It was a wonderful idea, and a social evolution, drawing questions as to what we as a community can achieve without the driver of competition.
